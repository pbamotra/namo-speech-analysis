आज का जो हादसा है , वह बड़ा ही दुखदायक है | कोई कल्पना नहीं कर सकता है कि मौत इस प्रकार से आ सकती है और इतनी बड़ी तादाद में गंभीर रूप से घायल लोग ...मैंने आज जहां हादसा हुआ , उस स्थान को देखा, उस मंदिर में गया था | कोल्लम के अस्पताल में गया, यहाँ के मुख्यमंत्री जी से बात हुयी है , जिन परिवारों ने अपने स्वजन खोये हैं उनके प्रति मेरी संवेदना है | जिनको injury हुयी है वह स्वस्थ हों , ऐसी मेरी ईश्वर से प्रार्थना है |
मैंने मुख्यमंत्री को कहा है कि जो serious patient हैं उनको अगर मुम्बई दिल्ली कहीं shift करना होगा तो भारत सरकार उसकी व्यवस्था करेगी| भारत सरकार पूरी तरह इस संकट की घड़ी में केरल के साथ है , दुखी परिवारों के साथ है | हादसा इतना भयंकर है जिसका शब्दों में बयान करना बहुत मुश्किल है | दो सौ दो सौ मीटर तक लोगों को injury हुयी है | अभी मुझे डाक्टर बता रहे थे कि कुछ ब्लास्ट तो ऐसे थे कि शरीर और माथा कहीं कहीं अलग हो गए| कितना भयंकर हादसा होगा इसका मैं अंदाज लगा सकता हूँ |  लेकिन भारत सरकार पूरी तरह इस दुःख की घड़ी में केरल के साथ है , दुखी परिवारों के साथ है और उन परिवारों के , केरल की जनता के साथ रहकर के पूरी मदद करेगी|
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will be visiting Afghanistan, State of Qatar, Switzerland, United States of America and Mexico from June 4, 2016 to June 8, 2016. In a series of posts from his Facebook Account, the Prime Minister said:  “Looking forward to my visit to Afghanistan tomorrow. I will join President Ashraf Ghani to inaugurate Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam in Herat. It is symbol of our friendship and would usher in hope, light up homes, nourish the fertile fields of Herat and bring prosperity to the people of the region. Look forward to meet my friend President Ashraf Ghani and exchange notes on regional situation and setting agenda for bilateral cooperation in the coming period. I will be visiting the State of Qatar on 4th & 5th June at the invitation of His Highness the Emir of Qatar. Look forward to meeting His Highness Sheikh Tamim whose landmark visit to India last year had ushered in a new momentum in our relations. I will have the honour to meet Father Emir who personally guided our relations for nearly two decades. This visit will nourish the historical bonds of friendship deeply rooted in people to people contacts, energy, trade and investment partnership. I will interact with the Indian workers at the Workers’ Camp and some of the members of over 6 lakh Indians who have nurtured our relations through their sweat and toil. Will also speak to Qatar business leaders to realise the full potential of our trade and investment cooperation. I will reach Geneva in the evening of 5th June on a bilateral visit to Switzerland, our key partner in Europe. I will hold talks with President Schneider-Ammann to deepen our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. In Geneva, I will meet prominent businesspersons. Our agenda will be to expand economic and investment ties. I will meet Indian scientists working at CERN. India takes pride in their contribution to exploring new frontiers of science in the service of humanity. I will be reaching Washington DC on a bilateral visit in the evening of 6th June at the invitation of President Barack Obama. In my meeting with the President on 7th June, we will seek to build upon the progress achieved in providing new vigour and momentum to our strategic partnership in diverse areas. Am looking forward to address the 40th AGM of the USIBC and meet US business leaders who have, over the past two years, shown renewed confidence in the India. I will exchange views with US think-tanks and attend a ceremony marking the return of Indian antiques. During my visit to Arlington Cemetery I will lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider and Space Shuttle Columbia Memorial, in which we lost an Indian origin astronaut, Kalpana Chawla. On 8th June, I will address a Joint Meeting of the US Congress. I thank Speaker Paul Ryan for inviting me to speak to Congressmen and Senators. During my visit to the US Capitol, I will also interact with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, many of whom have been valued friends of India and a strong votaries of deepening India-USA ties. India and USA are natural partners, two vibrant democracies that celebrate their diversity and pluralism. Strong India-USA ties benefit not only our two nations but also the entire world. I look forward to meeting President Peña Nieto on June 8 during my visit to Mexico, a privileged partner in the Latin American region. President Peña Nieto has ushered in far reaching reforms. I look forward to sharing our experiences. This is the first Prime Ministerial bilateral visit to Mexico after 30 years. Though short, the visit has a substantial agenda to take our partnership to new heights."
