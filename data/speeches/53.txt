स्‍वागत है मित्रों!
आज संसद का बजट सत्र प्रांरभ हो रहा है। देश के सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की निगाहें संसद पर, संसद की कार्यवाही पर, रेल एवं जनरल बजट पर केंद्रित है।
आज भारत की वैश्विक अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था में जो स्थिति बनी है उसके कारण विश्‍व का ध्‍यान भी भारत के इस बजट सत्र पर है। पिछले कई दिनों से लगातार सभी दलों से विचार-विमर्श चल रहा है। औपचारिकता से ऊपर उठ करके विचार-विमर्श चल रहा है। one-to-one भी काफी बातें हो रही है। और यह विश्‍वास मेरा है, कि संसद का समय का सदुपयोग होगा, सार्थकचर्चाएं होगी। देश के सामान्‍य नागरिकों की जो आशाएं-अपेक्षाएं हैं, उन पर गहन चिंतन होगा। अब तक जितनी भी मीटिंगे हुई हैं, सभी विपक्ष के साथियों ने जो सकारात्‍मक रुख दिखाया है, आज से प्रांरभ हो रहे सत्र में, और आने वाले दिनों में, उसका पूरा-पूरा एहसास देशवासयिों को जरूर होगा। मैं आशा करता हूं कि सदन का उपयोग गहन विचार-विमर्श के लिए होना चाहिए। सरकार की भी भरपूर आलोचना होनी चाहिए। सरकार की कमियां भी उजागर होनी चाहिए। और वही एक मार्ग है लोकतंत्र को मजबूत बनाने का, जन-सामान्‍य की आशा-आकांक्षाओं को परिपूर्ण करने का। बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद साथियों।

It is symbol of our friendship and would usher in hope, light up homes, nourish the fertile fields of Herat and bring prosperity to the people of the region.

I will be visiting the State of Qatar on 4th & 5th June at the invitation of His Highness the Emir of Qatar. Look forward to meeting His Highness Sheikh Tamim whose landmark visit to India last year had ushered in a new momentum in our relations. I will have the honour to meet Father Emir who personally guided our relations for nearly two decades. This visit will nourish the historical bonds of friendship deeply rooted in people to people contacts, energy, trade and investment partnership. I will interact with the Indian workers at the Workers’ Camp and some of the members of over 6 lakh Indians who have nurtured our relations through their sweat and toil. Will also speak to Qatar business leaders to realise the full potential of our trade and investment cooperation. I will reach Geneva in the evening of 5th June on a bilateral visit to Switzerland, our key partner in Europe. I will hold talks with President Schneider-Ammann to deepen our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. In Geneva, I will meet prominent businesspersons.

In my meeting with the President on 7th June, we will seek to build upon the progress achieved in providing new vigour and momentum to our strategic partnership in diverse areas. Am looking forward to address the 40th AGM of the USIBC and meet US business leaders who have, over the past two years, shown renewed confidence in the India. I will exchange views with US think-tanks and attend a ceremony marking the return of Indian antiques. During my visit to Arlington Cemetery I will lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider and Space Shuttle Columbia Memorial, in which we lost an Indian origin astronaut, Kalpana Chawla. On 8th June, I will address a Joint Meeting of the US Congress. I thank Speaker Paul Ryan for inviting me to speak to Congressmen and Senators. During my visit to the US Capitol, I will also interact with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, many of whom have been valued friends of India and a strong votaries of deepening India-USA ties. India and USA are natural partners, two vibrant democracies that celebrate their diversity and pluralism. Strong India-USA ties benefit not only our two nations but also the entire world. I look forward to meeting President Peña Nieto on June 8 during my visit to Mexico, a privileged partner in the Latin American region. President Peña Nieto has ushered in far reaching reforms. I look forward to sharing our experiences. This is the first Prime Ministerial bilateral visit to Mexico after 30 years. Though short, the visit has a substantial agenda to take our partnership to new heights."
